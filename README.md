### Introduction:
In this project, we asked for machine learning final project to choose a dataset

and to implement a machine learning classifiers.

### About the project:
We choose to work on the [Head CT-hemorrhage](https://www.kaggle.com/felipekitamura/head-ct-hemorrhage/?select=head_ct) dataset
and we decided  to implement those classifiers:
* KNN                       
* KNN WITH EARTH MOVER               
* SVM   
* ADABOOST
* DECISION TREE
* RANDOM FOREST
* CNN
